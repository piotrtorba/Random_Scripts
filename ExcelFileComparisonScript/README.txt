This is the Python Script to compare 2 MS Excel files and save the output to a .txt file.
The script requires Python 3.12 (x64) or newer, 'pandas', 'xlrd' libraries to work properly.
The files paths are assigned as static to variables 'file1' and 'file2' in line 26 and 27 of the script code.
To compare two files edit script code and paste your own files paths.
The script can be modified to ask user for files path as user input.
